# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Sepehr Rezaee**, a Bachelorâ€™s student in **Computer Science** at Shahid Beheshti University (2021â€“2025), Tehran. My current research and professional interests center around:

- **Deep Learning** (especially Computer Vision, Generative AI, AI Safety, and AI Agents)  
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and differential equation modeling  
- **Secure and robust machine learning**, including backdoor and trojan detection

## Experience

- **AI Specialist (LLMs) @ PropTy Global (2024â€“Present)**  
  - Developed an AI-powered chatbot and home-finder system with open-source LLMs (GPT-Neo, GPT-J, LLaMA) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation.  
  - Engineered a scalable backend using FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.  
  - Achieved significant improvements in chatbot accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance.

- **Research Assistant @ Robust & Interpretable Machine Learning Lab, Sharif University of Technology (2024â€“2025)**  
  - Contributed to multiple papers (3+ submitted to NeurIPS 2024) on model reliability and security.  
  - Built robust ML pipelines to increase model reliability under adversarial conditions.  
  - Presented research findings at international conferences.

- **Research Assistant @ AI & Scientific Computing Lab, Shahid Beheshti University (2023â€“2025)**  
  - Co-authored several papers (under review & accepted) on disease progression modeling, Fokker-Planck equations, and Alzheimerâ€™s detection using MRI.  
  - Leveraged PINNs for integrating physical laws into neural networks, improving scientific computing accuracy.

- **Deep Learning & Neuroscience Intern @ Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM) (2023â€“2024)**  
  - Performed comprehensive M/EEG data analysis to decode neural signals using advanced deep learning.  
  - Streamlined preprocessing and artifact removal for efficient, high-impact neuroscience research.
