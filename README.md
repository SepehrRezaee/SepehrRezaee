# Hi there 👋

I'm **Sepehr Rezaee**, a Senior AI Architect specializing in agentic LLM systems, retrieval-augmented generation, and safety-first platforms with 5+ years of experience designing and operating production multi-agent services.

- 🏫 **BSc in Computer Science, Shahid Beheshti University (2021–2025)**
- 🏗️ AI Engineer, Agentic Systems @ [PropTy Global, Dubai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/propty-global/) (2024–2025)
- 🧠 Research Intern @ [Mathis Lab, EPFL](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/) (2025)
- 🎓 Chief AI Officer & Multi-Agent Architect @ [Novel Mind Scientist, Tehran](https://www.linkedin.com/company/novel-mind-scientist/) (2022–2025)

My focus areas:

- **AI Architecture & Multi-Agent Systems:** Designing scalable production multi-agent services with SLOs, error budgets, and cost/latency controls
- **RAG Platforms & Safety:** Building retrieval-augmented generation systems with enterprise-grade governance and security
- **MLOps at Scale:** Orchestrating reliable AI systems with Docker/Kubernetes, monitoring, and observability
- **AI Security & Research:** Translating research on model security and evaluation into production practices
