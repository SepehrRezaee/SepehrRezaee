# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Sepehr Rezaee, a Bachelorâ€™s student in Computer Science at Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran. My research interests include:

- **Modeling disease progression** using differential equations and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN).
- **Developing robust and interpretable machine learning models** to ensure reliability in real-world applications.
- **Advanced deep learning analysis** of M/EEG data to understand neural mechanisms.

### Publications
I have contributed to high-impact conferences like NeurIPS and ICCCCC, with research focused on:
- Detecting backdoor attacks in neural networks (NeurIPS 2024)
- Novelty detection under style shifts (submitted to ICLR 2025)
- Early Alzheimerâ€™s disease detection using MRI data (ICCCCC 2023)

### Experience
- **Research Assistant** at the Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab, Sharif University of Technology: Developed secure ML pipelines and presented findings at international conferences.
- **Research Assistant** at the Artificial Intelligence and Scientific Computing Lab, Shahid Beheshti University: Modeled disease progression and utilized PICNNs for scientific computing.
- **Deep Learning and Neuroscience Intern** at the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM): Analyzed M/EEG data to decode neural signals.

### Teaching & Mentorship
- Head Teaching Assistant for **Advanced Programming** and **Data Mining and Analysis** at Shahid Beheshti University.
- Mentored projects on the application of AI in industries like petrochemical and water.
